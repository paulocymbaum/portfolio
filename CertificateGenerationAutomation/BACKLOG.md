   - Domain must have valid DNS records
   - Must be unique in the system unless explicitly allowed

3. **Course Names**
   - Must be 3-200 characters
   - Should not contain problematic special characters
   - Must match a list of approved courses if validation is enabled

4. **Certificate IDs**
   - Must be unique across all certificates
   - Should follow consistent format for verification
   - Must be securely generated to prevent guessing

### Test Environments
1. **Development Environment**
   - Personal Google account with test resources
   - Debug mode enabled
   - Frequent code changes and experimentation
   - No production data

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Organizational Google account
